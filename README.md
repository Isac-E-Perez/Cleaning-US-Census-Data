# Cleaning US Census Data Project
### About: 

For this project, I implemented data analysis using R. I used the libraries readr, dplyr and tidyr which helped me to build the project. I analyze the data of US census to gain a better undstanding and insight from the data.
 
### Note:

There is data from 10 different .csv of different states.
